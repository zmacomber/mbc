           <h3>A Biblical Baptist Church in Brunswick, Maine</h3>
           <br />
           <p align="left"><strong>Mid-Coast Baptist Church  was founded in 1999</strong> through the service of church planter, Bob Mitchell, Sr.,  and his son, Pastor Bobby Mitchell. They were sent to Brunswick by a New  Testament Baptist church in Virginia.&nbsp; As  co-founders of the church, they have worked together in the role of co-pastors,  with Pastor Bobby serving as lead pastor since 2002.</p>

           <p align="left"><strong>Over the years, as the church has endeavored to honor and to obey the Lord Jesus Christ,</strong> He has added to His assembly according to His wisdom and purpose.  Just as the Scriptures promise, each member of Mid-Coast Baptist Church is gifted to serve the Lord and His church.</p>
           <br />
           <p align="left">The goal of Mid-Coast Baptist Church is simple: Glorify  God. The Bible reveals that God is glorified by praise and service to Him that is offered according to the  commands given in Scripture and from willing hearts made willing and able by His grace.</p>
           <br />
           <p>Some of the ways in which the Lord is praised and served by Mid-Coast Baptist Church are:</p>
           <p><strong>Scriptural Singing of Psalms, Hymns, and Spiritual Songs<br />
Church Orchestra<br />
Tithing and Sacrificial Giving to Missions<br />
House-to-House Evangelizing<br />
Expositional Teaching and Preaching in the Assembly<br />
Keeping the Ordinances of Baptism and Communion<br />
Regular Prayer Meetings<br />
Holy Living in the Home and Society</strong></p><br />
<p align=left>God has wonderfully blessed this church, and we praise Him and thank Him continually for what He is accomplishing. <strong><em><span class="style1">"Except the LORD build the house, they labour in vain that build it"</span> (Psalm 127:1)</em></strong>.</p>
