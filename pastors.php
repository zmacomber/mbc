           <p align="left">In 1986, just two days before his 12th birthday, Bobby Mitchell was saved by the grace of God.  A few weeks later he was Scripturally baptized into a New Testament Baptist church where his father, Bob Mitchell, Sr., served as pastor.  <strong>The Lord immediately placed a desire in Bobby’s heart to preach the Bible.</strong>  At the age of 15, he began to fulfill that desire at every possible opportunity.</p>
<p align="left">During those early years of preaching, he earned money delivering newspapers and mowing lawns.  Later he worked on a farm, in a cabinet factory, as a waiter, and then for a small construction company.  At 23, after assisting his father in the start-up of Central Baptist Church of Belmont, New Hampshire, he was sent by his home church to work with his father in fulfilling the Great Commission (Matthew 28:18-20) in Brunswick. The Lord blessed their efforts and Mid-Coast Baptist Church was established in 1999. Since his ordination on November 2, 2002, Bobby has been the lead pastor at MCBC.</p>
<p align="left"><img class='img_indent'; alt='' src='images/pastorbobbymitchellphoto.png' />In October of 1997, just before he was sent to Maine, the Lord blessed Pastor Bobby with a faithful and loving wife, the former Daynna Whetstone.  God has given them 7 children to raise for His glory and they rejoice in the opportunity to train up their children in the will of God.</p> 
<p align="left"><strong>He received his pastoral training in the Biblical way (2 Timothy 2:2)</strong> as his father taught him the Word of God and trained him in the context of the New Testament church. That pattern continues as father and son are training other men at Mid-Coast Baptist Church who also are surrendered to serve as pastors.</p>
<p align="left">Pastor Bobby is a Biblical preacher who preaches for the glory of God, the salvation of the lost, and the edification of the local church.  He enjoys preaching and teaching through books of the Bible and seeing lives transformed by the work of the Holy Spirit through the Word of God.</p> 
<p align="left">He has been used to preach in many churches in the USA for Bible Conferences, camps, and other special meetings.  The Lord has also allowed him to preach and teach several times on the foreign mission field.  He is currently involved with several other pastors in writing a book on the Biblical teaching concerning church purity, with plans to do more writing in the near future.</p>
<p align="left">Pastor Bobby doesn’t just preach.  <strong>He takes seriously the duty of pastors to shepherd the flock of God.</strong>  He understands that the church he leads does not belong to him.  It belongs to the Lord.  For this reason he studies and works hard to ensure that he and the church operate according to the Lord’s commands that are clearly given in the Bible.  He is regularly involved in personal discipleship and counseling of the members of Mid-Coast Baptist Church.  He loves the Lord and the church that he is responsible to lead, and it shows in his zeal and commitment to the ministry.</p>
<p align="left">A favorite Bible passage that Pastor Bobby is often heard quoting is Proverbs 3:5,6: <strong><em>“Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.”</em></strong></p>

           <p align="left">Brother Bob Mitchell was saved by the grace of God during the spring of 1968.  He and his wife, Kathy, were married that summer, and shortly thereafter he was burdened to preach the Gospel.  From that time he has pastored two churches, the first in North Georgia, and the second in Western Pennsylvania.  After spending fourteen and a half years in the Pennsylvania church, <strong>God directed him into his present ministry of planting independent Baptist churches in the Northeast.</strong></p>

<p align="left"><img class='img_indent'; alt='' src='images/pastorbobmitchellphoto.png' />The Mitchells moved to Laconia, New Hampshire, to plant the Central Baptist Church in August of 1994. The church was established in October of 1995.</p>

<p align="left">In the fall of 1997, Brother Mitchell moved to Brunswick where he and his son, Pastor Bobby, were sent to fulfill the Great Commission.  The Lord blessed and the Mid-Coast Baptist Church is the result of His blessing.  <strong>He serves as a pastor at MCBC with a focus on administration and missionary work.</strong></p> 
<p align="left">Pastor Mitchell has a testimony of conviction, character, consistency, and charity with all who know him well.  He preaches the Word of God carefully and clearly, and the Lord has blessed His preaching everywhere it has been received.  His counsel is sought after by members of MCBC and even by other pastors across the USA.  His four children are all grown and serving the Lord in Baptist churches.  The Lord has also blessed him and Kathy with 22 grandchildren and 3 great-grandchildren.</p>  
<p align="left">Pastor Mitchell’s favorite Bible verse is 1 Corinthians 15:58: <strong><em>“Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.”</em></strong></p>
