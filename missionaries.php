           <p align="left">A Biblical missionary, also called an evangelist, is a man who has been set apart and sent by a New Testament church to preach the Gospel, baptize those that believe, and teach them the doctrine and practice that the Lord has given His churches as recorded in the Bible.</p>
           <br />
<p align="left">Mid-Coast Baptist Church is happy that we are able to contribute to the work of several such men who have been sent out of churches that have the same doctrine and practice that we have received from the Lord Jesus Christ.  We prayerfully and financially support missionaries who have been sent to Greenland, China, India, Nepal, and some needy cities right here in the USA.  In the future, as the Lord gives opportunity, we hope to assist more men in other areas of the world.</p>
